- URL for GitHub repository: https://github.com/chanvely/UnityBasicschan2.git
- URL for WebGL builds: https://chanvely.github.io/UnityBasicschan2/build_wasd_webgl/

- Changes I have made to the original mechanic: 
    add a movement to move diagnoally to the top-left with a 't' key and to the down-right with a 'z' key
- Screenshots of movement are included as a pdf file.

- Notice: My computer had a problem with committing to repository, so I used my friend's one to upload :( I hope you understand this situation!!
